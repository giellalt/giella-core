This document describes how to setup and use the new Giellatekno/Divvun
infrastructure.

Prepare your environment
========================

1. define the $GTCORE variable as follows (in ~/.bashrc or similar, but in the
same file where GTHOME is defined, and ***after*** the definition of GTHOME):

export GTCORE=$GTHOME/newinfra/gtcore

2. source ~/.bashrc (or the file you edited) or open a new shell

Basic Installation
==================

0. cd $GTHOME/newinfra
1. ./autogen.sh
2. ./configure
3. make
4. make check # optional
5. [sudo] make install

This will compile the transducers and other binary files directly in the source
code directory tree. If you prefer to build outside the source code, see the
section VPATH building below.

Options
=======

You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment. Here are some
relevant options:

--prefix=$HOME - installs the built binaries in suitable subdirs of your
                  $HOME dir
--enable-hfst  - turns on and checks for proper support for compiling hfst
                 transducers

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.

VPATH building
==============

The new infra supports VPATH building, aka out-of-source building. This feature
will do all building outside the source code directory tree, and leave the
source code mainly uncluttered (except for a few intermediate files created by
the autotools).

To use VPATH building, do the following instead of the Basic Installation:

0. cd $GTHOME/newinfra
1. ./autogen.sh
2. mkdir build   # or any other name, it is up to you
3. cd build      # cd into the dir you just created
2. ../configure  # from the new dir, call `configure' with the options you want
3. make
4. make check    # optional
5. [sudo] make install

This will result in the following directory structure:

newinfra/gtlangs/...       - source files - edit here
         build/gtlangs/... - makefiles, transducers - do make here

Known bugs with VPATH building
------------------------------

NB! The Xerox tools have a hard-coded limit to the argument lengths, which
causes failure when doing a VPATH builds (because all filenames get much longer
and together all filenames given to lexc sum up to more than the limit, such
that the last filenames will be trunkated or completely removed). The bug has
been reported to L. Karttunen.

That is, for now use VPATH with hfst ONLY, and regular in-source builds with
Xerox. Unfortunately you can't have both at the same time, so you have to decide
which one you want to build. Hopefully we will receive an update for the Xerox
tools soon, by which point you should be free to use VPATH builds for both Xerox
and hfst transducers. You can of course also build HFST transducers in-source,
so if you want to play with both technologies, then in-source building will be
fine (except for the fact that you get all binary files among the source files).
