# Giellatekno - a set of tools for analysing and processing a number
#               of human languages, expecially but not restricted to
#               the SÃ¡mi languages. The Giellatekno toolset also includes
#               support for buildling end-user tools such as proofing
#               tools and electronic dictionaries.
# The setup and init scripts (ao this file) are based on similar scripts
#               from the Fink project (http://www.finkproject.org/).
