     THIS TEXT IS A **COPY** OF THE ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE. This is NOT a fully
     styled and published dictionary. As such it can and
     will contain unfinished entries, unpublished entries, entries with
     objectionable translations, etc. If you find any errors or want to add more
     words, download the file, edit it, and send it back to
     <a>mailto:divvun@samediggi.no</a> and <a>mailto:giellatekno@hum.uit.no</a>.
     Please also note that the entries are sorted using NORWEGIAN sorting
     order, which is incorrect. It is nevertheless the probably the best sorting
     for SÃ¡mi dictionaries at the moment, using modern and standard software.
