/* The following rules are not working in XML Editor (XXE), but
   are working fine in modern browsers. We keep them here, and
   make a separate configuration file for XXE, where these rules
   are not included. The CSS in the configuration file is imported
   above, and thus shared between the browsers and XXE.

   That is: ONLY ADD HERE THINGS THAT ARE UNSUPPORTED IN XXE!
   All other CSS styling should be added to the shared CSS file
   in the XXE configuration. */
