! File for making transitivity tags optional. Used for generating transducers.
! The +ExXXX variants are used in some languages for pre-derivational transitivity
! tags, to ensure that only the last transitivity tag in a derivational row has
! the standard tags. This way root lemma transitivity is preserved without
! disturbing CG rules.
