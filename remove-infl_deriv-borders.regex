!Remove morhpological boundaries from the lower side of the transducer:

! Inflectional boundaries:
%> -> 0,
%< -> 0,

! Derivational boundaries:
%« -> 0,
%» -> 0,

! clitic boundaries, multichar symbols:
"|»" -> 0,
"«|" -> 0,

! Also make sure that escaped literal quotes are unescaped on the surface:
»7 -> »,
«7 -> «,
"_7" -> "_",
%[%>%] -> ">",
%[%<%] -> "<"
;
